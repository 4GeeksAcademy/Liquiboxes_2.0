### Backend Installation 🛠️:

1. **Ensure you have **Python 3.10**, **Pipenv**, and a database engine (PostgreSQL recommended). 🐍**
2. **Install Python packages:**
   
   ```bash
   $ pipenv install
   ```
  
3. **Create an `.env` file from the example:**

   ```bash
   $ cp .env.example .env
   ```
4. **Set up your database and configure the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable:**

| Engine    | DATABASE_URL                                      |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| SQLite    | sqlite:////test.db                                |
| MySQL     | mysql://username:password@localhost:port/example   |
| Postgres  | postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/example|

5. **Run database migrations:**
   
   ```bash
   $ pipenv run migrate
   ```

6. **Apply migrations:**
   
   ```bash
   $ pipenv run upgrade
   ```

7. **Run the application:**
      
   ```bash
   $ pipenv run start
   ```

> **Note**: Codespaces users can connect to PostgreSQL by typing:

   ```bash
   $ psql -h localhost -U gitpod example
   ```
